## Access GitHub support

All Alphagov users and external contributors (as long they have access to any Alphagov private repository) can request Enterprise Support directly from the GitHub team as a part of our [Enterprise Cloud][] agreement.

GitHub support team targets an eight-hour response, Monday to Friday (UK time zone).


### Request support

All authorized users need to use a dedicated [support portal][] to request Enterprise Support. 

It is recommended users will [Sign In][] before submitting any support requests. Users need to create a separate Enterprise Support account as regular GitHub account is not linked with Enterprise Support portal (hosted within a ZenDesk infrastructure).

Alphagov users should use `@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk` email during the sign up process to ensure their ticket is prioritised. Contributors need to state they are part of Alphagov organisation within their request.

Users can submit a new ticket using a [support request form]. When a request submitted successfully user will receive an email confirmation from GitHub team.
