# Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Most teams in GDS use [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) as their infrastructure provider. GDS teams manage their own AWS accounts, but users must first sign into a shared base AWS account called `gds-users`. They can then assume roles in their team's AWS account to perform administrative tasks using [AWS's cross-account access pattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html).
