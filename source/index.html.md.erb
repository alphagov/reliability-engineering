# <%= current_page.data.title %>

Reliability Engineering provide a shared platform to GDS teams comprising of tools to set up and maintain a service by:

* acquiring tools and where appropriate administer them for GDS like [Logit][]
* running off-the-shelf services for GDS as internal SaaS such as [Prometheus][]
* providing patterns and guidance like the [PaaS incident templates][]

To understand the context for our decisions and guidance you'll need to refer to the [Service Manual][] and the [GDS Way][].

## Platforms

Reliability Engineering develops, maintains and supports the [Amazon Web Services (AWS)][] and the [GOV.UK PaaS][] infrastructure GDS uses. GDS teams are responsible for the applications and components running on these platforms.

For example, Reliability Engineering is responsible for managing the SSL certificates that handle communications between AWS environments and virtual machines. GDS teams are responsible for managing certificates that protect messages used by their service.

### Monitoring

Reliability Engineering monitors [Amazon Web Services (AWS)][] and the [GOV.UK PaaS][] ensuring their availability. GDS teams must monitor their own applications and respond to alerts.

### Capacity

Reliability Engineering helps GDS teams manage their capacity until they have the capability to manage their own resources. GDS teams are responsible for performance testing their applications and fixing related problems at code level.

Reliability Engineering holds quarterly meetings, where GDS teams can:

* discuss scaling their environment
* address issues in service performance

For example, if there's an incident that could cause a performance spike, GDS teams should notify Reliability Engineering as soon as possible. This allows Reliability Engineering to make any related changes to a team's environment.

## Tools

Reliability Engineering provides tools to help GDS teams manage their environment. GDS teams can choose other tools if they develop, maintain and support them.

These tools have been procured for use by GDS teams, we are updating our recommendations on how we use them.

- [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence)
- [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/)
- [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/)
- [Statuspage](https://www.statuspage.io/)
- [Pingdom](https://www.pingdom.com/)
- [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.co.uk/)
- [Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/)
- [Tech Docs Template](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-template)

### Logging

Reliability Engineering uses [Logit](https://logit.io) to provision, manage and ensure availability of our logging infrastructure and provide [ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana)](https://www.elastic.co/elk-stack) stacks.

Reliability Engineering helps GDS teams:

* integrate Logit into their environments
* create their logging and usage policies

These guides will help you:

- [sign into Logit](manuals/logit-io-joiners.html)
- [remove users from Logit](manuals/logit-io-leavers.html)
- [send logs securely to Logit](manuals/logit-io.html)
- [respond to an incident with Logit](manuals/logit-incident-management.html)

### Metrics and Alerting

Reliability Engineering is running a beta service for GDS using [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for operational metrics.

Reliability Engineering provides client libraries which wrap Prometheus's own libraries so we can:

- provide an easy metrics choice for GDS teams
- supply consistent metrics and naming across different runtimes
- solve problems like, how to get metrics from all worker processes not just one
- guard the `/metrics` API behind HTTP basic auth for GOV.UK PaaS apps
- ease configuration by using framework-specific things such as [Railties][] or [Dropwizard][] bundles

You can setup application level metrics for your GOV.UK PaaS app using the guides on GitHub:

- [Ruby](https://github.com/alphagov/gds_metrics_ruby)
- [Java with Dropwizard](https://github.com/alphagov/gds_metrics_dropwizard)
- [Python](https://github.com/alphagov/gds_metrics_python)

Once you've setup your GOV.UK PaaS app with application metrics you can [monitor your PaaS app with Prometheus](manuals/monitor-paas-app-with-prometheus.html).

You can also [set up the PaaS metric exporter with Prometheus](manuals/set-up-paas-metric-exporter-with-prometheus.html) to gather container level metrics for your applications.

When using GDS metrics you can:

- [Display, create and edit Grafana dashboards](manuals/grafana-dashboards.html)
- [make and edit alerts with Prometheus for PaaS](manuals/alerting-with-prometheus-for-paas.html)
- [build custom metrics using Prometheus client libraries](manuals/add-custom-metrics.html)

Please contact us on the [#re-prometheus-support][] Slack channel to find out more.

GDS Metrics is currently in beta. These instructions are subject to change.

## Infrastructure as a Service

Several teams in GDS use [Amazon Web Services (AWS)][] as their infrastructure provider.

GDS teams manage their own AWS accounts, but users must sign into a shared base AWS account managed by Reliability Engineering. You can find out:

- [how to create AWS accounts][]
- [how AWS cross account access works][]

Reliability Engineering supports each GDS team's existing service levels until standardised support is agreed across GDS.
