title: How to remove access to Logit
---

# <%= current_page.data.title %>

When people leave GDS their G Suite account is cancelled, so they'll lose access to Logit but the actual Logit account will not be deleted.

It's important that when people leave GDS, you also delete their logit account so it's clear who in GDS has access.
