If you do not have a Logit account you can create one by signing into Logit for the first time. Once you've created an account you must always sign into Logit the same way.

## How to sign in

To sign into Logit:

1. Log into any G Suite app, such as GDS GMail or Calendar.
1. Click on the 9 small dots at the top right of the page.
1. click **More** at the bottom to show more options.
1. scroll down and click on the **Logit** icon.
1. You're now signed into the Government Digital Service Dashboard.

If you use **Log in with Google** on logit.io you will not sign into the GDS Dashboard.

Once your user account is created, you'll need access to your team's logging stacks, your team's Tech Lead should be a Logit administrator who will add your account.
