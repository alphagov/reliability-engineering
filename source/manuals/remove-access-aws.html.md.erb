If you need to remove someone's AWS access because they've either left GDS or no longer need access to AWS resources, complete the **Request user removal** section of the [Request an AWS account][] form. This will ensure leavers are removed from the `gds-users` base account.

Team's are responsible for managing their own leavers process.
