title: How to request AWS Accounts
---

# <%= current_page.data.title %>

GDS teams can request as many AWS accounts as required, for example one production and one non-production account.

Using multiple [Amazon Web Services (AWS)][] accounts allows GDS teams to:

* enforce administrative isolation between workloads
* minimize the impact of security breaches
* isolate audit data in separate accounts

AWS Answers has more information about [AWS Multiple Account Security Strategy][].

## Request an account

To request an AWS account complete and submit the [request an AWS account form][].

Reliability Engineering will confirm if your account is eligible for inclusion in GDS AWS billing and perform the initial account setup.

Once your account is created you'll recieve an email with the account ID and will be able to assume an administrative role from [the GDS users base account][].

## Setup an account

Your account will be created with a `bootstrap` role which has full admin
rights.

All users in the [Request an AWS account form][] will be able to assume the `bootstrap` role from [the GDS users base account][]. For more information read [accessing AWS accounts][].

You should use the `bootstrap` role to set up your new account following your
team's best practices, for example using [Terraform][].

As part of your account setup, ensure your users can assume
roles with the appropriate permissions.

Remove the `bootstrap` role once you've added a properly configured admin role.
